# Rock Papers Scissors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:  
1. Paper covers Rock  
2. Scissors cuts Paper  
3. Rock crushes Scissors

*Choose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Buit with [Python 3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0)
